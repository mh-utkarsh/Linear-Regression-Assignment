## General Information
- Project Information: This assignment aims to give an idea about how to build a multiple linear regression model. Specifically, we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- Project Background: A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- Business Problem: In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits. The company wants to know:
  1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
- Dataset: The data set is a csv file with the daywise rental count of the BoomBikes bike sharing company along with relevant features.

## Conclusions
- Demand of bikes depend on Year, Workingday, Temperature, Wind speed, Seasons- Spring, Summer, Winter, Months- July & September, Weekday- saturday, Weather -Light_snowrain, Misty.
